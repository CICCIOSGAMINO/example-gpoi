Cyber Resilience Act
====================
[TOC]

v0.0.1 - 11/08/2025

The EU Cyber Resilience Act is a new law that mandates cybersecurity-by-design for all products with digital elements (both hardware and software) sold in the EU. It places legal obligations on manufacturers to ensure their products are secure throughout their lifecycle, and to transparently report exploited vulnerabilities.

# Main Parts of the Act

## Which Products are Covered?
Very broad the act covers almost any product with digital elements whose intended or foreseeable use includes a direct or indirect data connection to a device or network.

This includes:
- Software (including open source software)
- Hardware (including IoT devices, computers, smartphones, etc.)
- Embedded systems (like those in cars, medical devices, etc.)
- Cloud services and platforms
- Network equipment (like routers, switches, etc.)
- Industrial control systems (like SCADA systems, PLCs, etc.)
- Smart home devices (like smart thermostats, security cameras, etc.)
- Wearable technology (like smartwatches, fitness trackers, etc.)
- Any other product with digital elements that connects to a network or device

**Excluded** Some specific products like medical devices and EVs (cars in general) are excluded as they are covered by other, sector specific regulations

## Key Obligations for Manufacturers

### Security by Design and Default
Manufacturers must integrate cybersecurity measures into the design and development of their products from the outset (from the earliest stages of development).This includes:
- Conducting risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities
- Implementing security features such as encryption, authentication, and access controls
- Ensuring that products are secure by default, meaning that the most secure settings are enabled out of the box 

### Vulnerability Handling
Actively identify and document vulnerabilities and ensure they are addressed through security updates without delay.

Security Support Period: Clearly define and declare the "support period" for which the product will receive security updates. This must be a minimum of 5 years, or for the product's "expected lifetime."

Conformity Assessment: Undergo a process to prove they meet the CRA's requirements before placing the product on the market.

CE Marking: Affix the CE marking to show the product complies with the regulation.

3. Transparency & Incident Reporting
Vulnerability Disclosure: Manufacturers must publicly report fixed vulnerabilities and provide a common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) score.

Exploited Vulnerability Reporting: They must report any actively exploited vulnerability to ENISA (the EU Agency for Cybersecurity) within 24 hours of becoming aware of it.

Information to Users: Provide clear and understandable information about the product's security, its support period, and how users can securely install updates.

4. Obligations for Software Suppliers
The CRA explicitly covers "products with digital elements," which includes software. This means software vendors, including those offering SaaS, must ensure their software is developed securely and must manage vulnerabilities throughout its lifecycle, just like hardware manufacturers.

5. Enforcement & Penalties
Market Surveillance Authorities: National authorities in each EU member state will be responsible for enforcement.

Significant Fines: Non-compliance can lead to fines of up to â‚¬15 million or 2.5% of the company's total global annual turnover (whichever is higher).

Market Withdrawal: Authorities can order the withdrawal or recall of non-compliant products from the EU market.

6. Timeline
The regulation was formally adopted by the European Parliament in March 2024.

It will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.

Manufacturers will then have 36 months to comply, except for the reporting obligation for exploited vulnerabilities, which applies after 21 months.
